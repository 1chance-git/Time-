# Scientific Foundations: Continuation, Information, and Time

## Proof of Continuation
TimelineAI anchors every memory as part of an unbroken, cryptographically verified chain.  
Each memory includes:
- A cryptographic hash of the previous memory.
- A timestamp secured by Proof of Time.
- A delay function that proves real-world time has elapsed.

This ensures that the user's Digital Twin grows **sequentially and authentically**, making tampering, fast-forwarding, or rollback attempts cryptographically detectable.

## Information Theory Application
TimelineAI leverages Information Theory to optimize and prioritize memories:
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measuring novelty or importance of memories.
- **Signal-to-Noise Optimization**: Filtering repetitive, redundant, or corrupted data.
- **Lossless Compression**: Structuring memory graphs for efficient storage without meaning loss.

By treating memories as information signals, TimelineAI constructs **smarter, sharper, and more meaningful** personal cognitive models.

## Time Theory Application
TimelineAI goes beyond simple chronological recording by applying Time Theory:
- **Causality Anchoring**: Verifying that memory order matches causal reality.
- **Subjective Time Mapping**: Adjusting the weight and emotional gravity of memories based on perceived time distortion.
- **Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs)**: Cryptographic proofs that verify real-world passage of time.

This allows the system to map both **objective clock time** and **subjective emotional time** into the memory structure, creating timelines that feel both real and alive.
