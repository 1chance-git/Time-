# TimelineAI

**TimelineAI** is an open-source platform that enables individuals to track, analyze, and optimize their time by creating a personal, interactive timeline of their activities. With the help of AI-powered suggestions, insights, and a recursive approach to understanding time, users are empowered to maximize their productivity while exploring alternate paths through life’s events.

**Founder:** Chance Johnson  
**Open Source:** Yes  
**Version:** 1.0

## **Mission**

At TimelineAI, we believe that **time is the true currency** of life. Our mission is to help users invest their time wisely through the use of interactive timelines, recursive insights, and dynamic suggestions. Time, once spent, cannot be reclaimed, but through reflection and intelligent guidance, we can better use the present to create a more meaningful future.

## **Key Features**

- **Inverted Timeline:** Allows users to experience their timeline in reverse, showing the last event first and going backward in time. This unique perspective lets users analyze decisions and actions in reverse chronological order, encouraging deep self-reflection.
- **Recursive Feedback Loop:** The app will allow users to explore recursive paths where actions repeat or re-emerge in different contexts, allowing for deeper insight into their habits and time allocation.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Receive feedback and suggestions that will continuously evolve based on your activities and past behaviors.
- **Cryptographic Identity:** A unique "Timeline Address" for each user, ensuring privacy and data integrity.
- **Modular Structure:** Scalable and adaptable to integrate additional features like blockchain-based time tracking, social sharing, and personalized resource generation.
- **PWA Support:** Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline functionality and easy installation on mobile devices.

## **Roadmap**

1. **Phase 1:** MVP development with time tracking, AI suggestions, and basic analytics.
2. **Phase 2:** Integrate recursive timelines that allow users to traverse events in multiple directions, enabling deeper reflection.
3. **Phase 3:** Implement an inverted timeline that shows the user’s history backwards to promote self-awareness and introspection.
4. **Phase 4:** Develop blockchain-powered "TimeChain" for decentralized time tracking and personal data management.
5. **Phase 5:** Create mobile apps for iOS and Android that support both timeline inversion and recursive feedback.

## **Founder’s Statement**

TimelineAI is a project I started because I believe time is the most valuable resource we have. I wanted to create something that would allow everyone to track and reflect on their time in a meaningful way. By incorporating both **inversion** and **recursion**, we can see our past actions from new perspectives and make better decisions for the future.

This is open-source. Let’s build something extraordinary together.
